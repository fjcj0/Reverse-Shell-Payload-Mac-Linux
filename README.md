# Reverse Shell Example (Educational Use Only)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This code is intended **for educational purposes only** and should only be run in a controlled lab environment on systems you own. Using it on systems without permission is illegal.

## Description

This Python script demonstrates a basic reverse shell connection for educational purposes. It connects back to a predefined server IP and port and provides a shell over the network.

Key points:

- Uses the `socket` module to establish a TCP connection.
- Redirects standard input, output, and error streams to the socket.
- Uses `pty.spawn("sh")` to spawn an interactive shell.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Network access to the target server (controlled lab environment)
- Appropriate permissions to run scripts and open network connections

## Usage

1. Set up a listener on your machine (educational lab):
   ```bash
   nc -lvp 4444
